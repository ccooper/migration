        Run tests for Windows 7 builds in TaskCluster EC2 instances in try,
        debugging host- and taskcluster-related issues along the way.

    title: "Linux32/64 and android nightlies at tier2"
    milestone: true
    due: 2016-12-02
    done: true
    description: |
        Nightlies for the linux32, linux64, and Android platforms are
        implemented on a project branch, and can be dogfooded by team members.
        Balrog updates are included, along with all of the other particulars.

    milestone: true

    done: true
    description: |
        While we are not yet ready to shift production load to
        taskcluster-worker on hardware (the transition requires use of BBB and
        shifting all mac builds and tests to tier 1), we are confident that the
        tests will function correctly at that point.

linux-android-tier1:
    title: "Linux32/64 and android at tier1"
    milestone: true
    due: 2017-01-17
    description: |
        All builds and tests for the linux32, linux64, and Android platforms
        are running in TaskCluster at tier 1, with Buildbot jobs demoted or
        disabled. All tasks are scheduled via TaskCluster, but hardware-only
        tasks are executed via BBB.  Since tier-1 opt builds are what we ship
        to users, this also requires nightlies and preparations for making full
        releases when they are due.

        - linux32-opt-tier1

        Linux64 talos jobs are green in TaskCluster, and (almost) all hardware
        Buildslaves have been reimaged to run taskcluster-worker directly.

    description: |
        MacOS X Tests and Talos are green in TaskCluster and (almost) all
        test machines have been reimaged to run taskcluster-worker directly.
        This needs to happen before the hardware begins moving in 2017Q3, as
        that move will take most of a year.

macosx-all-tier1:
    title: "Mac OS X at tier 1"
    description: |
        This is a "flag-day" moment where we simultaneously:
          * enable in-tree scheduling of test/talos tasks via BBB
          * disable sendchanges from Buildbot builds and demote to Tier 2
          * promote TC opt and nightly builds to tier 1

    description: |
        Buildbot is almost completely unused -- with the exception of ESR and
        Thunderbird, which we just have to wait for.  The Buildbot
        infrastructure is drastically scaled back and left to run until it is
        no longer used.
